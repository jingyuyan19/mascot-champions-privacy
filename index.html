  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Effective Date: October 7, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Mascot Champions AR</strong> (“the App”).  
  This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our augmented reality (AR) web application powered by Snap Camera Kit.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>We collect only the minimum data necessary to provide the AR experience:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera Access:</strong> The App requires access to your device camera to render AR effects and track your movements while you interact with virtual mascots and sports scenes.</li>
    <li><strong>Microphone Access (optional):</strong> If you enable audio interactions, the App may access your microphone to detect sounds or voice reactions during gameplay. No voice recordings are stored or transmitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Facial Expression and Pose Data:</strong> For gameplay scoring and animation effects (e.g., jumping or smiling actions), the App processes facial expressions and body movements locally on your device using Snap’s Camera Kit technology. No biometric data is stored or transmitted to our servers.</li>
    <li><strong>Device and Performance Data:</strong> We may collect anonymous diagnostic data (such as device type, operating system, and crash logs) to improve stability and performance.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To enable real-time AR experiences and scoring interactions.</li>
    <li>To generate motivational messages and feedback during gameplay.</li>
    <li>To improve user experience and fix technical issues.</li>
    <li>To ensure compatibility and performance across devices.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
  <p>Mascot Champions AR does <strong>not</strong> permanently store any images, videos, or biometric information.  
  All camera data and motion analysis happen locally on the user’s device.  
  Diagnostic data, if collected, is anonymized and used solely for technical maintenance.</p>

  <h2>5. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.  
  However, we use certain third-party services that may process data under their own privacy terms:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Snap Camera Kit:</strong> Provides AR rendering and lens functionality. Snap Inc. may collect anonymous usage data as described in its <a href="https://snap.com/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Hosting Provider:</strong> Our web app is hosted on a third-party platform (e.g., GitHub Pages or Netlify), which may log general access data (such as IP addresses and timestamps) for security and service operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>This App is not directed toward children under the age of 13.  
  We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.  
  If we learn that we have inadvertently collected data from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly.</p>

  <h2>7. User Control and Permissions</h2>
  <p>You may revoke camera or microphone access at any time through your browser or device settings.  
  Without these permissions, certain AR features will not function, but you can still close the App without consequence.</p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>We use standard web security measures (HTTPS, limited data retention, and no external tracking cookies) to protect your privacy.  
  However, no online service can guarantee absolute security.</p>

  <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>The App may be hosted on servers outside your country.  
  By using Mascot Champions AR, you consent to the processing and transfer of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically.  
  Significant updates will be reflected by revising the “Effective Date” above.</p>
